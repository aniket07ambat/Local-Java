// Notes
// javac FileName.java : converts our code into byte code i.e is .class file.
// So Now File.class is generated.
// java FileName: to run our code.

// public: Public means this class is accessed by anyone.

// class : class is just named group of properties and functions
// methods : All the functions in the class are called methods.

// Demo : Demo function is entry point for Java program.
// If you write your file name "Demo.java" then you must write 
// "public class Demo" you can't write "public class anyOtherName." 

// static : with this we can excute our code without needing to initiate a class making it the entry point of the program.




public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
